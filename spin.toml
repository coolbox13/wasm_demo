# This is the original Spin component. It handles /api requests.

# --- Component 2: Static file server (serves browser WASM + HTML) ---
# This uses a pre-built Spin component that serves files from a directory.
# It serves index.html, the .wasm file, and the JS glue — everything the
# browser needs to run client-side WASM.
